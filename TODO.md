# Claude Steward — TODO

Canonical task list. Completed items → `archived_tasks.md`. Milestone context → `docs/roadmap.md`.

---

## Planned

### Mini-App Platform
- [ ] **`steward-app.json` manifest spec** — `name`, `type`, `devCommand`, `port`, `buildCommand`; the pluggable contract that makes any project embeddable
- [ ] **Sidecar process manager** — spawn/stop/restart mini-app processes per project; `GET /api/projects/:id/app/status`, `POST /api/projects/:id/app/start|stop`
- [ ] **Split-panel UI** — resizable divider; iframe embed of running mini-app; collapse/expand to full-screen
- [ ] **Project templates** — starters for `docs` (MkDocs-style), `notebook` (live code cells + output), `webapp` (Vite + React + Leaflet for travel-type apps)
- [ ] **Claude as app maker** — scaffold new mini-apps via chat, modify files, trigger live-reload via sidecar manager

### Scheduler
- [ ] **Scheduled conversation resume** — `schedules` table (`id`, `session_id`, `cron`, `prompt_context`, `enabled`); `node-cron` runner injects context-aware wake messages ("would you like to resume the conversation about X?")
- [ ] **Push notifications (scheduler)** — extend the existing push infrastructure to fire when a scheduled session produces output; also consider a per-session opt-in so Claude reply notifications can be toggled per session rather than globally
- [ ] **Scheduler UI** — list/create/toggle schedules; associate with a session; set reminder text

### Core UX
- [ ] **Favicon** — add a favicon for the client app

### Workspace / Files
- [ ] **MCP support** — pass `--mcp-config <path>` to spawn args; `mcp_configs` table per project; UI to manage JSON configs

### Integrations
- [ ] **Amazing Marvin** — scheduled session that pulls tasks from Marvin API, summarizes via Claude, pushes updates back

### Dev / Production Workflow
- [ ] **Production deploy workflow** — develop + test on `dev.steward.jradoo.com` → `npm run build` → `POST /api/admin/reload` hot-reloads `steward.jradoo.com`; document and wire up the build step so deploying is a single command
- [ ] **Environment switcher UI** — floating toggle (authenticated users only) to navigate between `steward.jradoo.com` (prod) and `dev.steward.jradoo.com` (dev); consider long-press on header to avoid accidental switches; works in Capacitor WebView too

### Safe Core
- [ ] **Extending safe core** — discuss splitting into multiple focused safe-cores: current one stays as the Claude Code emergency interface; a second could expose read-only DB queries (session/project browser); further cores could cover other admin tasks. Consider shared port-allocation convention and a lightweight process registry.

### Permissions
- [ ] **Fine-grained tool permissions per session** — the current Plan/Edit/Full triad is coarse. Explore `--allowedTools` / `--disallowedTools` CLI flags (support patterns like `Bash(npm:*)`) to allow command-level whitelists and blacklists. Possible UX: an "Advanced" mode in the session header that exposes an editable allowed-tools list, stored as `allowed_tools TEXT` on the sessions row and passed via `--allowedTools` at spawn time.

### Testing
- [ ] **Migration unit tests** — cover the three startup scenarios in Vitest: (1) fresh DB → `seedStewardProject` creates the project with correct name/path; (2) existing DB with orphaned sessions → `migrateOrphanedSessions` reassigns them; (3) existing DB with steward project already present → both functions are true no-ops (no duplicates). Each test gets its own `DATABASE_PATH` temp file via the existing `setup.ts` pattern.
- [ ] **Fresh-install integration test** — container or isolated-directory smoke test that simulates a real first-run: clone (or copy) the repo, create a minimal `.env`, run `npm install && npm start`, then assert: steward project present in `GET /api/projects`, server returns 200 on `/api/meta`, safe-mode reachable on `:3003`. Candidate approaches: a `Dockerfile.test` (most hermetic) or a GitHub Actions job on a clean runner with no pre-existing DB.

### Packaging
- [ ] **Capacitor shell** — thin native wrapper (iOS + Android + desktop) using Capacitor's remote URL mode pointing at the server; `mobile/` package in monorepo with `capacitor.config.ts`; no bundled assets — always loads from server URL
